# Steganography
HIDING DATA IN IMAGE
## About Project
This project implements Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography to hide and extract text messages within images. It uses Python and OpenCV to encode messages in the least significant bits of pixel data, preserving image quality while securely storing information.
## Features

- Hide text messages inside images using LSB technique.
- Extract hidden messages from modified images.
- Preserves original image appearance.
- Saves output image as a new PNG file.
- Adjustable bit-depth for balancing between image quality and capacity.
- Works with any lossless image format

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x	Main programming language
- OpenCV (cv2)	Image processing library
- NumPy	Efficient array manipulation
- LSB Encoding	Technique to embed data in the lowest bits of image pixels
